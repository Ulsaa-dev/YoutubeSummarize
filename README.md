## DEFINITION
This an app for summarizing youtube videos.
## USAGE
You need to get the id of the youtube video that you want to summarize. Look at the video url and take whatever is after "watch?v=...".
For example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
In this case the id should be dQw4w9WgXcQ.
After that you have the specify the language that your summary should be returned in, not the video summary's language!
Also you can specify a model between gpt-4o and gpt-3.5-turbo. And boom you get your results.
## SPEED
It is pretty quick. From my experience it can summarize a video in any length at around 10 seconds
